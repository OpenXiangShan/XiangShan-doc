## DiffTest-H: Toward Semantic-Aware Communication in Hardware-Accelerated Processor Verification

Published at *the 58th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO 2025)*. DOI: [10.1145/3725843.3756108](https://doi.org/10.1145/3725843.3756108).

Our paper introduces DiffTest-H, a hardware-accelerated co-simulation framework for processor verification.
It covers several optimizations to minimize communication overhead while preserving instruction-level debuggability.
This framework is open-sourced and deployed in the XiangShan verification flow, receiving all three available badges for artifact evaluation.

## XiangShan: An Open-Source Project for High-Performance RISC-V Processors Meeting Industrial-Grade Standards

Published at *2024 IEEE Hot Chips 36 Symposium (HCS)*. DOI: [10.1109/HCS61935.2024.10665293](https://doi.org/10.1109/HCS61935.2024.10665293).

Developing an open-source industrial-grade high-performance processor is a challenging undertaking. With best-in-class performance, XiangShan is an open-source project for RISC-V processors. To maximize overall efficiency, XiangShan adopted a collaborative hardware development model, teaming up with industry partners on processor design, implementation, and verification.

## Towards Developing High Performance RISC-V Processors Using Agile Methodology

Published at *the 55th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO 2022)*. DOI: [10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00080](https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00080).

Our paper introduces XiangShan and the practice of agile development methodology on high performance RISC-V processors.
It covers some representative tools we have developed and used to accelerate the chip development process, including design, functional verification, debugging, performance validation, etc.
This paper is awarded all three available badges for artifacts evaluation.

This paper has been selected as an IEEE Micro Top Pick from the 2022 Computer Architecture Conferences.
The updated article is published at *IEEE Micro*'s annual special issue in July/August 2023. DOI: [10.1109/MM.2023.3273562](https://doi.org/10.1109/MM.2023.3273562).
