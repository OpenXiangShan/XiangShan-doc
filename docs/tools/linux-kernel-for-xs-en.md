# Build Linux Kernel for XiangShan

## 1. How to build a minimal Linux Kernel that can run on Xiangshan or NEMU in a simulation environment

> Note: Please prepare the riscv64 toolchain in advance, the possible prefixes are `riscv64-linux-gnu-`, `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-`, `riscv64-unknown-elf-`. You may refer to https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain to setup toolchain needed by Linux.

- Clone riscv-pk, riscv-linux, riscv-rootfs from Xiangshan project, which are Bootloader, Linux kernel and rootfs respectively. Then checkout to target branch. These three repos must be laid **in the same directory**.
    - https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/riscv-pk (noop branch)
    - https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/riscv-linux (nanshan branch)
    - https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/riscv-rootfs (master branch)
- Set environment variables
    - NEMU_HOME: Path to NEMU (you may `source env.sh` in `xs-env`)
    - NOOP_HOME: Path to XiangShan (you may `source env.sh` in `xs-env`)
    - RISCV_ROOTFS_HOME: path to `riscv-rootfs`
    - RISCV：Installation path of riscv-gnu-toolchain ( the top directory including bin, inlcude, lib etc.)

    > You can see [riscv-gnu-toolchain official documents](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) to install riscv-gnu-toolchain. You can also see [GCB tool chain instructions](../compiler/gnu_toolchain-en.md) if you need to compile B extension GNU tool chain for Xiangshan.

- build rootfs
    - Enter `riscv-rootfs` directory
    - In simulation environment, we let Linux Kernel start on the ramfs, so first prepare the initramfs that you want to run, and you can put the workload you want to run in it. By default we use riscv-rootfs/rootfsimg/initramfs-emu.txt, which runs hello under Linux. Modifications on this are introduced in the following chapter. 
- Build the Linux Kernel Manually
    - Enter `riscv-linux` directory
    - Use the default emu_defconfig to configure. The command is `make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- emu_defconfig`
    - (Optional) Modify config according to your own needs through menuconfig, the command is `make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- menuconfig`
    - Compile, the command is `make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- -j`
    - If succeed, a vmlinux file will be generated in the directory
    - ( You may choose to skip the compilation here, since the following BBL Makefile includes this)
- Build BBL and Kernel, then link Kernel
    - Enter `riscv-pk` directory
    - Configure the device tree, let `platform.dtsi` symlink to the `noop.dtsi` in `riscv-pk/dts`
    - Run `make -j`, this command will automatically compile the Linux Kernel, link it to BBL as a payload, and finally package it into a build/bbl.bin binary image. After that, Xiangshan is able to run this image (See Makefile).

- Others
    - There is a small problem with Makefile dependency of riscv-pk, so after any modification, please **`make clean`** first in riscv-pk
    - Please prepare the riscv64 tool chains in advance, you may use `riscv64-linux-gnu-`, `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-` and `riscv64-unknown-elf-`

## 2. Run BusyBox and some simple applications in Linux

* Reconfigure the Linux Kernel
    * Enter `riscv-linux` directory
    * Use `fpga_defconfig` to configure, the command is `make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- fpga_defconfig`
    * Modify config according to your own needs through menuconfig, the command is `make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- menuconfig`, **change the source of initramfs** from `${RISCV_ROOTFS_HOME}/rootfsimg/initramfs.txt` to `${RISCV_ROOTFS_HOME}/rootfsimg/initramfs-autorun.txt`
* Modify rootfs as appropriate
    * Go to `rootfsimg` directory in `riscv-rootfs` directory
    * initramfs defines the content of file system, and inittab will be executed during initialization
    * Modify the contents of initramfs-autorun.txt and inittab to run the programs you want after Linux has booted (stream and redis by default)
* Reconfigure BBL
    * Enter `riscv-pk` directory
    * Modify the size of address space size in dts, so that programs using larger memory can be supported
    ```shell
    # ./riscv-pk/dts/noop.dtsi

	L11: memory@100000000 {
	    device_type = "memory";
	    -reg = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x2000000>;
        +reg = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x80000000>;
	};
    ```
    * `make clean` run `make -j` to generate bbl.bin, which could be run on NEMU or XiangShan



## 3. Based on this, how to run Debian distribution on NEMU

* Reconfigure the Linux Kernel
    * to the riscv-linux directory
    * Use debian_defconfig to configure, the command is `make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- debian_defconfig`
* Reconfigure BBL
    * Enter `riscv-pk` directory
    * Modify the bootargs in dts
    ```shell
    # ./riscv-pk/dts/noop.dtsi

	chosen {
        -bootargs = "root=/dev/mmcblk0 rootfstype=ext4 ro rootwait earlycon";
        +bootargs = "root=/dev/mmcblk0p1 rootfstype=ext4 ro rootwait earlycon";
    };
    ```
    (Please see [https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/NEMU/tree/master/resource/sdcard](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/NEMU/tree/master/resource/sdcard))
    * After `make clean` run `make -j` to generate `bbl.bin`
* Configure NEMU
    * Enter `NEMU` directory
    * Edit `src/device/sdcard.c`, find the sdimg variable in the init_sdcard() function and assign it to the path of the Debian mirror (for the generation of the Debian mirror, please refer to [How to create a Debian image](./debian-en.md))
    * Recompile NEMU, and then run build/bbl.bin under the riscv-pk project


## 4. How to run Debian distribution on Xiangshan

* Configure Xiangshan
    * Enter `Xiangshan` directory
    * Edit the `./difftest/config/config.h` file, set the SDCARD_IMAGE macro to the path to the Debian image
    * Rebuild Xiangshan, then run build/bbl.bin under the riscv-pk project


#### 5. Based on this, how to build dualcore Linux kernal
* Reconfigure the Linux Kernel
    * Enter riscv-linux directory
    * `make clean`
    * Use emu_defconfig, fpga_defconfig or debian_defconfig to configure, command is same as above
    * Use menuconfig to configure SMP，the command is `make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- menuconfig`, in Platform type submenu, set Symmetric Multi-Processing to Yes, save it and exit
* Reconfigure BBL
    * Enter riscv-pk directory
    * `git stash`
    * `git checkout dualcore`
    * Modify the size of address space size in dts
    ```shell
    # ./riscv-pk/dts/noop.dtsi

	L11: memory@100000000 {
	    device_type = "memory";
	    -reg = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x2000000>;
        +reg = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x8000000>;
	};
    ```
    * When running 16g Debian, modify the bootargs in dts
    ```shell
    # ./riscv-pk/dts/noop.dtsi

	chosen {
        -bootargs = "root=/dev/mmcblk0 rootfstype=ext4 ro rootwait earlycon";
        +bootargs = "root=/dev/mmcblk0p1 rootfstype=ext4 ro rootwait earlycon";
    };
    ```
    * After `make clean` run `make -j` to generate `bbl.bin`

#### `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc: command not found`

Make sure riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc is in your PATH

#### `unrecognized opcode: fence.i, extension zifencei required` 

Change the Makefile of kernel by appending `_zicsr_zifencei` to `KBUILD_AFLAGS` and `KBUILD_CFLAGS`.
```patch
-KBUILD_AFLAGS += -march=$(KBUILD_MARCH)$(KBUILD-ARCH_A)fd$(KBUILD_ARCH_C)
+KBUILD AFLAGS-march=$(KBUILD_MARCH)$(KBUILD_ARCH-A)fd$(KBUILD_ARCH_C)_zicsr_zifencei

+KBUILD_CFLAGS += -march=$(KBUILD_MARCH)$(KBUILD_ARCH_A)$(KBUILD_ARCH_C)_zicsr_zifencei
```

#### `undefiend symbol MEM_START+0xa0000 referenced in expression` 

Add spaces around `+`: `. = MEM_START + 0xa0000`

#### `repo/stream.c: No such file or directory`

Ignore it

#### `riscv-rootfs/rootfsimg/build/busybox could not be opened for reading`
