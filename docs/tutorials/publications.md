## Towards Developing High Performance RISC-V Processors Using Agile Methodology

Published at *the 55th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO 2022)*. DOI: [10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00080](https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00080).

Our paper introduces XiangShan and the practice of agile development methodology on high performance RISC-V processors.
It covers some representative tools we have developed and used to accelerate the chip development process, including design, functional verification, debugging, performance validation, etc.
This paper is awarded all three available badges for artifacts evaluation.

This paper has been selected as an IEEE Micro Top Pick from the 2022 Computer Architecture Conferences.
The updated article is published at *IEEE Micro*'s annual special issue in July/August 2023. DOI: [10.1109/MM.2023.3273562](https://doi.org/10.1109/MM.2023.3273562).
