# [XiangShan Biweekly 87] 202510-13

Welcome to XiangShan biweekly column! Through this column, we will regularly share the latest development progress of XiangShan. We look forward to your contribution.

This is the 87th issue of the biweekly report.

We are very pleased to share two pieces of news with you.

On September 20, the XiangShan team won the first Open Source Contribution Award from the CCF Architecture Committee. This collective award holds special significance for the XiangShan teamâ€”it represents recognition and support from our academic peers for the open-source processor and the team itself, laying the foundation for XiangShan to have a broad impact. The XiangShan team will continue to move forward, step by step, striving to keep XiangShan alive for 30 years!

On September 22, Innosilicon released the "Fenghua 3" full-featured GPU. The "Fenghua 3" GPU successfully integrated the XiangShan "Nanhu" processor IP core, which is performance-competitive with the ARM Cortex-A76, as its high-performance on-chip main control CPU. This integration marks a new phase in the industrial application of open-source high-performance CPU IPs and signifies that RISC-V can carve out a path different from the traditional ARM model.

We believe that open-source chips do not equate to low performance or low quality. Open source will profoundly change the cost structure of chip development, providing a new paradigm for chip design in the industry.

In the past two weeks, the frontend has fixed functional and performance bugs caused by the integration of the new BPU, while continuing performance exploration and tuning. The memory access and cache teams have fixed some bugs and refactored some code to advance the development of V3.

We use SimPoint to sample programs and create checkpoints images based on our custom format. The coverage of SimPoint clustering reaches 100%. Note that the above scores are estimated based on program segments rather than a complete SPEC CPU2006 evaluation, which may deviate from the actual performance of real chips.
