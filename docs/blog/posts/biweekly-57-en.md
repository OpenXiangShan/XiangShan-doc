# 【XiangShan Biweekly 57】20240819

Welcome to XiangShan biweekly column, this is the 57th issue of our biweekly column. Through this column, we will regularly introduce the progress of XiangShan, hoping to learn and improve together with you.

Recently, various teams working on Kunminghu have continued to advance optimizations in area, timing, and power consumption. In addition, the frontend fixed the cross-page exception bug introduced by the IFU refactoring, the backend completed the design of the register file cache, and the memory and cache section completed the CHI-L3 code design and integrated it into the Xiangshan system testing. This update also includes the latest performance improvements of the Kunminghu architecture.

## Recent developments

### Frontend

- **Bug Fixes**
    - The RAS predictor now blocks the BPU pipeline to handle speculative queue overflow, instead of ignoring the overflow ([#3389](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3389))
    - Fixed the cross-page exception bug introduced during the code refactoring for IFU exception handling, and also fixed a legacy bug here from Nanhu micro-architechture.

- **RVA23 Profile**
    - `prefetch.i` instruction from the Zicbop extension ([#3396](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3396))
    - Svpbmt ([#3404](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3404))

- **Area & Power**
    - Changed the ITTAGE predictor updating mechanism from checkpointing (stored in the FTQ) to reading again when updating ([#3367](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3367))

- **Timing Optimization**
    - Optimized the ready signal logic passed to the frontend Ibuf ([#3293](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3293)).
    - Optimized the read pointer and output logic of the Ibuf bypass ([#3344](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3344)).
    - Removed some dead paths from loadCancel to the dispatch queue and BusyTable ([#3374](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3374), [#3382](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3382), [#3364](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3364)).

- **Reg Cache**
    - Completed the design of the Reg Cache, which has been merged into the master: the number of register read ports reduced from 15 to 10, with integer performance improving by 1.5% compared to the base ([#3290](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3290)).

- **Difftest**
    - Added FCSR/PC to Difftest, fixed vector and floating-point related CSR comparison mechanisms ([#3359](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3359), [#3294](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3294)).

- **RVA23 Profile**
    - Supported may-be-operations/Compressed may-be-operations extension(Zimop/Zcmop) ([#3409](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3409)).
    - Sstvala/Shvstvala passed smoke tests.
    - RTL Implementation of Additional floating-Point instructions/Vector/minimal half-precision floating point extension(Zfa/Zfhmin/Zvfhmin) is completed and currently under testing.

### MemBlock and cache


- **CHI Bus**

    - CHI-L3 (OpenLLC) completed the code design and was integrated into the Xiangshan system test. The CHI-L2+OpenLLC+DummyLLC (CHI2AXI) SoC was built, successfully running single-core CoreMark and Linux-hello.

    - Support for CHI's CMO instructions was added to OpenLLC.

    - The design plan for the CHI2AXI bridge was formulated, and RTL design began.

- **RVA23 Profile**
    - Scalar unaligned memory access (Zicclsm + Zama16b) extensions: passed riscv-test with virtual memory, ready to be merged into master ([#3320](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3320))
    - Cache manipulation (Zicbom + Zicboz) extensions: support for CBO instructions is being added to NEMU and DiffTest.
    - Software prefetching (Zicbop) extension: completes the software data prefetching part ([#3320](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3320))
    - Page-based Memory Attributes (Svpbmt) extension: adds Svpbmt basic path support ([#3404](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3404))
    - 48-bit virtual memory management (Sv48) extension: passed Sv48 & Sv48x4 tests and completed timing evaluation, ready to be merged into master ([#3406](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3406))
    - Completed the RVA23 CMO code design and integrated it with the OpenLLC TL-Test framework that supports CMO requests, successfully running single CMO requests.

- **Performance**
    - Added a TP metaBuffer on L2 TP meta to cache valid TP meta, alleviating negative competition between TP meta and L2 data; introduced a TP switch based on access frequency, turning off TP during high memory access.

    - The L2 Tubins replacement algorithm was tested and showed a performance increase of 0.15% compared to the DRRIP replacement algorithm.

    - The L3 Chrome replacement algorithm, after unit test framework trace stimulation testing and parameter tuning, showed a 27% hit rate increase on mcf but a decrease at some checkpoints; further exploration of EQ space compression was conducted.

- **Tools**
    - The TL-Test framework iteration now can parse TL Logs into traces (TL Trace), serving as a test stimulus.

- **Timing Optimizations**
    - Fixed a number of MemBlock critical paths, mainly including issue & writeback of scalar load / store instructions ([#3208](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3208)). Currently MemBlock internal violations are around -60ps and Backend-MemBlock port violations are around -125ps.

## RTL Evaluation

We used SimPoint for program sampling and created checkpoint images based on our custom Checkpoint format, with a **SimPoint clustering coverage of 100%**. SPEC06 was compiled using gcc12 with O3 optimization enabled, the jemalloc memory library, and the `-ffp-contraction` option for SPEC06FP set to fast. The instruction set used was RV64GCB. We ran SPEC06 fragments on the XiangShan processor **version 9d9be651a from August 12** (**configured with 64KB L1 ICache, 64KB L1 DCache, 1MB L2, and 16MB L3, and a 3ld2st LSU**) in a simulation environment. DRAMsim3 was used to simulate DDR4-3200 memory latency with a CPU running at 3GHz. Below are the estimated SPECCPU 2006 scores:

**The scores above are evaluated based on program fragments, not a full SPEC CPU 2006 evaluation, and may differ from the actual performance of the real chip!**

## Afterthought 

XiangShan Open Source Processor is under agile development, new features and new optimisations are continuously added, we will regularly synchronise our open source progress through the XiangShan biweekly column. Thank you for your attention, and welcome to communicate with us in the background!

In the late stage of XiangShan Kunminghu architecture development, XiangShan's performance will be announced once a month. Please look forward to it.
